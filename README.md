### Hello, I'm Alberto!

I'm a recent graduate in Computer Science and Engineering MSc at Politecnico di Milano
I wrote my research thesis in Operations Research and Online Learning for User History-Dependent Advertising, submitted to NeurIPS 2023 conference. 

My interests are mainly Machine Learning and Software Engineering. 

I worked as a Business Intelligence Engineer at [Amazon] (https://www.amazon.jobs/it/business_categories/transport) in the Global Transportation Team, where I gained experience in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and ETL Data Pipelines.
